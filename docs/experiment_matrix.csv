# Summary Statistics:
# - Main Experiment: 18 configs × 50 runs = 900 runs
# - Power Analysis: 5 configs × 50 runs = 250 runs
# - Total: 1150 runs
# - Estimated total time: ~530 hours CPU time
#   (With 4 cores: ~130 hours = 5-6 days wall-clock time)

# Priority Explanation:
# - HIGH: Core thesis results (GA vs PSO comparison)
# - MEDIUM: Additional weight variants (for sensitivity analysis)
# - LOW: Power analysis (supplementary results for Section 5.3)

# Notes:
# 1. Est_Time_min assumes ~18 sec per run (based on N_sensors complexity)
# 2. For S1 (6 sensors): ~10 sec/run → 50 runs = ~8-10 min
# 3. For S2 (15 sensors): ~25 sec/run → 50 runs = ~20-25 min
# 4. For S3 (25 sensors): ~40-50 sec/run → 50 runs = ~35-40 min
# 5. PSO typically 20% faster than GA (fewer fitness evaluations)
